Welcome! I&#39;m Storm, a second year PhD student at the Institute for Gravitational Research at the University of Glasgow, 
working on gravitational wave astrophysics. In particular my work focuses on using gravitational wave data and machine learning techniques
to understand the origins of stellar mass black holes and how their progenitors evolved.
